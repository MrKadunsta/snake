    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hey, I'm lilrollieguy. I am a coder who codes for fun. This project was my attempt at learning django and pygame, which the snake game was originally programmed in. I am also a Minecraft modder, you can find me on Curseforge or Modrinth. I also sporadically code on scratch. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my game!</p>
